I primarily utilize C++ for a lot of Win32 API programs, interacting with the Windows Kernel on a low level. I design programs that utilize: 
Opening Processes and windows, process enumeration, thread enumeration, DLL and Code injection, as well as debuggers and fuzzers, and hardware 
interaction. The win32 API is so big and vast there's no worry of running out of programs to write using it. I love API programming. As for C,
I use it for basically the same purpose, except I use it to interact with the Linux Kernel on a low level.
