Memory BreakPoint Technique

//Declare the SYSTEM_INFO Struct variable 
//Declare the MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION struct variable
//Use the GetSystemInfo() to secure information about the current system 
//Create variable of type DWORD to hold the value of the Page size of the system

SYSTEM_INFO SysInfo;
MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION mbi;
DWORD DefaultPageSize;
ZeroMemory(&SysInfo, sizeof(SYSTEM_INFO));
DefaultPageSize = SysInfo.dwPageSize;

//Begin Querying all the memory pages of the target Process 
//Change the permissions of any memory pages in question (set them to guard pagein our case)
//Change the permissions of any memory pages in general
